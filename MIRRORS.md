# Mirrors

We maintain a mirror on GitHub at <https://github.com/KerbaeAdAstra/KerbalFuture>. This mirror is updated daily at midnight UTC, so there will be discrepancies between the primary development repository (found at <https://repo.nothuman.online/KerbaeAdAstra/KerbalFuture>).

Pull requests will not be accepted on the GitHub mirror, since they are a pain to merge back into the primary development repository. Consider submitting a patch through email or contact one of the administrators for an account on the KaA GitLab.
