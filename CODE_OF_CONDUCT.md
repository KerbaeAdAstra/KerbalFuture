# Kerbae ad Astra Code of Conduct

The Kerbae ad Astra group wishes to extend the warmest welcome to any and all contributors. In order to accomplish this, we ask the following things from you.

## Discord Server

The rules to the official Kerbae ad Astra Discord server, accessible [here](https://discord.gg/hRv6yq8), are present in the #rules channel. You will be asked to read and acknowledge them before being granted access to the server itself.

## GitLab

To combat spambots, registration on the official Kerbae ad Astra GitLab repository has been disabled. Should you wish to have access to the repository, please contact us at kerbaeadastra@gmail.com and we will consider your case.

Once you have obtained access to the repository, you may submit new issues or MRs [Merge Requests], or comment on existing ones. These comments should be kept on topic and shall not make personal attacks or condescending statements. These include:

* Making a request to close said issue or MR because "you are not experiencing the problem".
* Arguing about the content of issues or MRs, either created by yourself or others.
* Trying to justify issues or MRs after they have been closed by Kerbae ad Astra staff.
* Making issues or MRs without a purpose.
* Unhelpful creation of issues such as "it is completely broken". These do not help anyone in any way, and create much more unnecessary communication and waiting time for the issue to be fixed.

## Consequences for misconduct

### Consequences: Discord Server

Punishments for misconduct are issued at the staff members' discretion.

### Consequences: GitLab

Misconduct will result in blocking and/or loss of member privileges, up to and including removal of any and all inappropriate wiki edits, commits, comments, issues, and merge requests.

### KSP Forums, including any and all Kerbae ad Astra maintained threads

An immediate report to the KSP forum moderators will be made - punishments (or the lack thereof) will be decided by them.

### Reports of Abuse

We take abuse very seriously. If you would like to make a complaint of abuse or harassment, please send us an email at kerbaeadastra@gmail.com. We will review each case thoroughly, and may invite you into a private session to discuss the incident. All findings will be kept confidential, unless otherwise stated or requested.

### Thank you for visiting Kerbae ad Astra, and enjoy your stay!
