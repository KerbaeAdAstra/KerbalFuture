	description = The eigth engine in a series of new designs based on the breakthroughs of Benjamin Kerman's Welding Supply Company, this engine folds space and pokes a hole through it as a means of almost instantaneous travel. Warning, any parts over 24 meters when using this drive alone will be subject to unexpected particle scattering.
