	description = The first engine in a series of new designs based on the breakthroughs of Benjamin Kerman's Welding Supply Company, this engine folds space and pokes a hole through it as  means of almost instantaneous travel. Warning, any parts over 5 meters when using this drive alone will be subject to unexpected particle scattering.
